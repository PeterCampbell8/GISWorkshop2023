What we did:
- Components of the QGIS workspace
- Projections and CRS and how they affect your data
- Vector layers: their types and composition
- Raster layers: their types and composition
- How to load in data, and a brief foray into using the tool box

Plan for next week:
- brief review
- Overall, make presentable figures using layouts
- Using field calculator and SQL
- Simple shape/layer manipulation using the toolbox
- importing images as rasters?
