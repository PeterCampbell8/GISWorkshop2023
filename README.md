# GISWorkshop2023
This repository is meant to hold files and general notes for the 2023 QGIS/GIS workshop at the University of Kansas. 
Each Monday (starting on 9/18) we will meet at 1pm on the 7th floor.
The plan is to start with basics of QGIS, including the GUI, file types, the processing toolbox, and other resources.
Each week we'll discuss topics and tools relevant to workshop members.
